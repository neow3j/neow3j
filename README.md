Neow3j is a Java library that aims to provide easy and reliable integration with NEO nodes.
By using neow3j, you will happily play with NEO and end up neow'ing around like [Bongo Cat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bongo-cat).

You can now focus on building Java/Android applications that use the functions provided by the NEO blockchain, without being concerned about writing specific code to integrate with NEO nodes.

Visit http://docs.neow3j.io for more information on neow3j and the technical documentation.

Neow3j is an open-source project developed by the community and maintained by [AxLabs](https://axlabs.com).
